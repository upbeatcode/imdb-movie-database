# Movie Filter App

This is a React-based web application that allows users to filter and sort a list of movies based on various criteria such as genre, decade, year, rating, and date rated. The app provides two filtering modes: **Normal Filter** and **Cumulative Filter**.

## Features

### **Normal Filter**
- Filter movies by a single criterion (e.g., genre, decade, year, rating, or date rated).
- Navigate to specific filter pages (e.g., `/genre/Romance`, `/year/2011`).

### **Cumulative Filter**
- Apply multiple filters simultaneously (e.g., genre + year + rating).
- Clear all filters with a single button.

### **Additional Features**
- **Sortable Table**: Sort movies by title, year, runtime, IMDb rating, user rating, date rated, number of votes, or release date.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Sticky Header**: The table header remains visible while scrolling through the movie list.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation and routing.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.
- **Git**: For version control.
